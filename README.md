# age-in-place
This project describes the home automation being added to our house remodel project. The overall goal is to put things in place that help us age gracefully, maintain our privacy, and not get in the way. Every function must pass the Wife Test and have a high SAF (spousal approval factor). 

The project is currently broken down into the following sections:
  Security
    Alarm system
    Surveillance system
  Environment
    HVAC
    Weather/Air quality
  Lighting
  Media
    Apple TV
    Plex
    OTA
  Network
    Wired
    WiFi
    IoT
  System Management
    Raspberry Pi
    Webmin
    Glances
    Portainer

I'm no expert and will be borrowing heavily from the community. These repositories will contain what I found out as a way of giving back. I thank you all in advance for advancing my knowledge and helping me out.
